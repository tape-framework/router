#### About

`tape.router`

Integrates the [reitit](https://github.com/metosin/reitit) router via a
`tape.module` module, and provides a few handy ways to navigate.
The router is optional and can be left out in apps that don't need one.

#### Usage

You must be familiar with [reitit](https://github.com/metosin/reitit),
`tape.module` and `tape.mvc` before proceeding.

##### Install

Add `tape.router` to your deps:

```clojure
tape/router {:local/root "../router"}
```

##### Module & routes

In `config.edn` add `:tape.router/module` and define routes:

```edn
{:tape.profile/base
 {:my.app/routes [["/hi/:say" :sample.app.greet.controller/hi]]}

 :tape.router/module nil
 ...}
```

Routes are collected from the system map from keys derived from `::c/routes`.
Note: `(c/defmodule)` collects vars annotated with `^::c/routes` adds them to
the module map and derives them, so you can add routes in your controllers:

```clojure
(def ^::c/routes routes
  ["/people"
   ["" ::index]
   ["/show" ::show]])
;; ...
(c/defmodule)
```

A route resolves to a namespaced keyword that gets dispatched on route match:
`[::greet.c/hi parameters]`. The `parameters` has a `:path` map with params
matched in the path, and a `:query` map with params matched in the query. The
keyword is also the name of the route.

##### Navigate

```clojure
(ns sample.app.my-ns
  (:require [tape.router :as router :include-macros true]
            [sample.app.greet.controller :as greet.c]))
```

To navigate we use the route name and a params map that fills the route params
slots; we have the following utilities:

- `(router/href* [::greet.c/hi {:say "Hi!"}])` returns the path `::greet.c/hi`
  with path params filled from the provided map `m`. Is used in hiccup anchor
  hrefs: `[:a {:href (router/href* ...)}]`.
- `(router/navigate* [::greet.c/hi {:say "Hi!"}])` to navigate to a route, used
  in DOM event handlers (on-click etc).
- `[::router/navigate [::greet.c/hi {:say "Hi!"}]]` a Re-Frame event to that
  can be dispatched to navigate to a route.
- `{::router/navigate [::greet.c/hi {:say "Hi!"}]}` a Re-Frame effect to that
  results in the browser navigating to a route.

##### Navigate via Ergonomic API

Ergonomic API uses macros with symbols of controller event handlers. Such
symbols can be navigated via IDE "jump to definition". The macros are
macroexpanded in the API above, so there's no performance penalty at runtime.

- `(router/href [greet.c/hi {:say "Hi!"}])`
- `(router/navigate [greet.c/hi {:say "Hi!"}])`
